## Description

The password generator was created to facilitate students' learning of essential programming concepts. These concepts include implementing variables for data management, using arrays to organize and access different character sets like lowercase and uppercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters, which are crucial for creating secure and diverse passwords. Moreover, students learn to create functions to encapsulate specific code segments, like password generation and user input validation. Additionally, if statements are employed to control the program flow, ensuring the user's input adheres to required criteria, such as a password length between 8 and 128 characters. The generator utilizes for loops to repeat actions, randomly selecting characters from the available set to construct the final password. By mastering these fundamental JavaScript principles through this project, students can deepen their understanding and proficiency in programming.

## Installation


To get started with the learning materials, follow these steps for installation:

Access the class repository on GitLab and download or clone the repository to your local machine.

Create a separate repository on your local machine. This repository will serve as your personal workspace to work on your website.

From the class repository you downloaded, locate the challenge folder and copy and paste the files into your new repository. 

Watch the new video provided for the password challenge, where the instructor talks about the initial code needed to start the program.

Ensure that the program contains the following arrays: lowercase alphabet, uppercase alphabet, numbers from 0 to 9, and special characters.

Ensure that the program asks the users to input the length of the password to be between 8 and 128 characters.

## Usage

The password generator allows users to create more secure passwords for their websites by incorporating diverse character sets and specifying the desired password length. This enhances the overall strength and complexity of the passwords, helping to protect sensitive information and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
